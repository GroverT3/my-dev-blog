      <h2>Welcome to My Journey</h2>
      <p>
        Hola, my name is Grover. I'm a self-taught developer, music producer, and father with roots in L.A. County, the Inland Empire, and all over SoCal. I’ve been making music since 2006, starting out in a home studio with my friend Elon in Chino. Made my first website with my Aunty Carolyn when I was around 9 or 10. Truly was hooked into computers from there. I first got into coding in high school, just for fun. I enjoyed changing MYSPACE around like everyone else but after a discouraging job experience in my 20s, I stepped away from tech for a while. Now, I’m back with a purpose — mostly to prove to myself that the only factor to growing is consistency and desire. To code projects that have meaning to me and make cool music along the way. <strong>BE ENCOURAGED. YOU CAN DO WHAT YOU SET YOUR MIND TO.</strong>
      </p>

      <p>
        This portfolio blog is part of an 8-month plan to transform my life. Pushing my music harder than ever, rebuilding my coding skills from scratch, and showing up for my kids and myself every step of the way. I'm picking up where I left off, but with more focus, more courage, and no fear of failure. This is more than a portfolio — it’s proof that it’s never too late to bet on yourself and chase the life you want.
