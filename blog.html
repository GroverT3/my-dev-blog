    <h2>Weekend Project: Building a Game from Scratch (Blog 1.5)</h2>
    <time datetime="2025-04-19">April 19, 2025</time>
    <p>
      This weekend was different. I wasn’t just learning, I was building. For almost 8 hours straight, I was locked in with my AI tutor, starting from an empty folder and ending with a fully playable prototype. No templates, no shortcuts. Just raw HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, all handwritten in Neovim. It was a crash course in frontend development, and it felt like leveling up in real time.
    </p>

    <p>
      The goal was clear: make something small, make it playable, and make it mine. We landed on a <strong>Math Card Game</strong>. Simple in concept, but packed with learning. Designed for kids but useful for anyone wanting to sharpen mental math, the game asks players to click number and operator cards to solve fast-paced equations. You’ve got 30 seconds to get as many correct as you can, with bonus points for using multiple operators. After three rounds, the scores are tallied up. It’s fast, fun, and sneakily educational.
    </p>

    <p>
      Every part of the game was hand-coded. The HTML structures the board, the cards, the timer, and the scoreboard. CSS handles the layout, spacing, animations, and responsive design. And JavaScript? That’s where the magic happens. It manages question generation, input tracking, round timers, scoring logic, sound feedback, and resets. For the first time, I wasn’t just copying code. I understood what each line did.
    </p>

    <p>
      You can <a href="https://your-math-game-link.com" target="_blank" class="highlight-blue">play the game live here</a>. The <a href="https://github.com/yourusername/math-card-game" target="_blank" class="highlight-yellow">source code is open on GitHub</a> if you want to follow along or remix it. I’ll keep pushing updates as I learn new tricks and features to add.
    </p>

    <p>
      After finishing the game, I circled back to the blog itself, editing HTML and CSS directly to tweak the layout, update links, and keep the design clean and minimal. Every keystroke taught me something, and that’s what’s been the most powerful part of this journey so far. It’s not just the result, it’s how much I’ve grown by doing it myself.
    </p>

    <p>
      A week ago, I was brushing up on basic syntax. Now I’m deploying projects. That shift didn’t happen by accident, it came from showing up every day, staying curious, and being willing to get a little uncomfortable. Progress doesn’t always feel like a leap. Sometimes it’s just one good weekend.
    </p>

    <p>
      I’m doing this as a co-parent, music producer, and late bloomer to tech. If I can find time between work shifts, family life, and music sessions to build this, so can you. You don’t need to be a prodigy, you just need a plan, a little guidance, and the drive to keep going.
    </p>

    <p>
      Week 2 officially starts Monday, but this little "blog 1.5" moment is proof that weekends can be powerful. Next up: polish the game, improve the layout, and start building out a full main menu and theme selector. Stay tuned and if you’re on your own journey, keep showing up.

        <h2>Week 1: Why I’m Learning Web Development</h2>
        <time datetime="2025-04-15">April 15, 2025</time>
  	<p>This week, I officially began my journey into web development. But for me, it’s more than just picking up a new skill. It’s about rebuilding a life with intention. As a co-parent, music producer, and lifelong creative, I need a path that supports growth in all the areas that matter: flexibility, creative expression, and purpose.</p>

  	</figure>

  	<p>Right now, I’m refreshing my understanding of HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. The core building blocks of websites. What’s wild is how much faster I’m moving now that I have a sense of direction. Every day I’m building smarter, making connections that used to feel random, and stacking real momentum. Up next: learning React to bring sites to life with interactive features, and diving into Python to start creating the logic and automation behind the scenes.</p>

  	<p>But this isn’t my first dance with tech. Back in the early 2000s, I was already getting into Linux as a teenager, trying to find the perfect “distro” (short for distribution. Like a flavor of the Linux operating system) that could run all my favorite music software. I was downloading and testing anything that played nice with Debian or Arch, pushing every plugin I could find just to see what I could make work.</p>

  	<p>That’s also how I first met the terminal...The black screen with white text where you type in commands to interact directly with your system. No mouse, no menus. Just pure control. For someone who grew up clicking on icons to open things, it can seem intimidating at first. But the terminal is actually a powerful conversation between you and your machine. You say exactly what you want, and it either listens or throws an error you’ll learn from.</p>

  	<p>By the time I was 16, I was using Linux for just about everything. I even started fixing other people’s computers on the side for a little extra cash. Looking back, all those hours spent editing config files, troubleshooting installs, and testing audio tools were training ground. I didn’t realize it then, but those skills with patience, problem solving, creative hacking are the same ones I’m using now as I become a developer.</p>

  	<p>Music has always been part of the story, too. Around 2004, I was constantly looking for ways to level up my sound using whatever tech I could get my hands on. Whether it was weird open-source audio software, DIY gear setups, or finding ways to run pro-level tools on older machines. I was always experimenting. I didn’t mind failing a hundred times if it meant getting one thing to finally work. That’s how innovation happens. That’s how creativity gets stronger.</p>

  	<p>Now, I’m looping everything I’ve learned back into the present. I’m choosing to code with clarity, produce with passion, and parent with presence. This blog is part dev journal, part life log, and part creative archive. I’m here to document not just the wins, but the unexpected lessons and quiet progress that happens when you commit to real change.</p>

  	<p>If you’re reading this and you’ve ever felt like it’s “too late” to start something new. I’m living proof that it’s not. I’m just getting started. Let’s build something from the ground up, together.</p>

  	<p>To shake things up, I decided to try something different: using AI as a tutor. Instead of just asking it to write code for me (which doesn’t help me learn), I use it to guide me. Kind of like having a personal coach. I’ll still read books, go through a giant Udemy course, and build projects I actually care about. But with AI, I get fast feedback, personalized help, and round-the-clock support.</p>

  	<p>After reading some Reddit threads about AI prompting, I figured I’d give it a shot. Now I get two homework assignments a day from AI. Usually small challenges that push me just enough. I block out time in my schedule, do the exercises, and track my progress. I can ask as many questions as I want without ever feeling rushed or judged. It’s not the same as having a real person next to you but if you’ve got patience and clear goals, AI can be a surprisingly helpful guide. So far, it’s working.</p>

  	<p>My goal isn’t to let AI do the work. It’s to help me grow faster and smarter. I’ve set an 8-month plan to land a development role, and that puts real fire in my soul. I love the challenge, and I know that the real magic happens when you master the fundamentals. That’s why I’m focusing on the basics deeply. So far, the exercises in HTML, CSS, and Flexbox have been great. The moment I saw HTML structure again, something clicked. It was like running into an old friend you hadn’t seen in years.</p>

  </h3>

  <p>My code editor OR as I like to call it, my weapon of choice is <strong>Neovim</strong>. For those who’ve never heard of it, Neovim is a modern reimagining of <strong>Vim</strong>, one of the oldest and most legendary text editors out there. Vim's been around since <strong>1991</strong> (yeah, it’s older than Google), and it's still going strong in 2025. Some folks even call it “the hacker’s editor” because it looks like you're coding inside the Matrix. But once you learn how to wield it, you realize just how powerful it really is.</p>

  <p>Neovim takes that legacy and supercharges it by adding better plugins, smoother navigation, and more modern tools. I’m learning fast, and the more I use it, the more it feels like second nature. I’m finally starting to understand how <strong>file paths</strong> work on a deeper level, which makes working with folders and projects so much easier. Every time I move between files, create new components, or split my screen with a few key strokes, it feels like I just leveled up.</p>

  <p>To some people, it might look like I’m just typing into a black box but truuuuuuust meeehehe, behind the scenes, there’s a creative rhythm to it. Neovim isn’t just an editor; it’s a mindset. Minimal, fast, and endlessly customizable—just like the journey I’m on.</p>

  <p>So whether I’m building a layout in HTML, adding some Flexbox magic with CSS, or testing out a new React component soon. I’m doing it all inside Neovim, powered by muscle memory, curiosity, and a whole lot of ctrl-keys. It’s become my daily dojo, and I’m grateful for every “ah-ha” moment it gives me.</p>

  <p>If you’re reading this and you’ve ever felt like it’s “too late” to start something new. I’m living proof that it’s not. I’m just getting started. Let’s build something from the ground up, together.</p>
