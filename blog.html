      <h2>Week 1: Why I’m Learning Web Development</h2>
      <time datetime="2025-04-15">April 15, 2025</time>
<article>
   <p>This week, I officially began my journey into web development. It’s more than just picking up a new skill, it’s about rebuilding a life with intention. As a co-parent, music producer, and lifelong creative, I need a path that lets me grow in all the areas that matter: flexibility, expression, and purpose.

  <p>I’m currently relearning HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. With fresh eyes and real momentum. Every day I’m moving quicker, building smarter, and stacking knowledge that used to feel scattered. Up next: I’m diving into React to create interactive, dynamic web experiences, and Python to build logic and backend workflows that match my creative process.
   </p>

   <p>But my love for tech didn’t start this year. Back in the early 2000s, when I was just a teenager, I was already messing around with Linux operating systems. I was on a mission to find the perfect distro (distribution) that could run all my favorite apps and music tools in one place. I tried everything I could get to work with Debian, pushing every music program I could install. That’s how I first met the terminal window.
   </p>

   <p>For the non-coders out there, the terminal is that black screen with white text where you type commands directly into the system. It looks old school and a little intimidating, but it’s a powerful tool. It’s like having a direct conversation with your computer. No fancy buttons, just raw control.
   </p>

   <p>By 16, I was using Linux for almost everything and fixing computers for extra money on the side. I didn’t realize it at the time, but those moments, troubleshooting broken installs, editing config files, testing audio plugins laid the foundation for the developer I’m becoming now.
   </p>

   <p>Musically, I was also trying to stay ahead of the curve. In 2004, I was searching for any way to move my sound forward using tech. Whether it was experimenting with open-source software, tracking beats on weird DAWs, or wiring up old gear to something new. I wanted to innovate, even if it meant failing a hundred times just to make one thing work. What a funny, wild, and fun time to be alive.
   </p>

   <p>Now, I’m looping all of that back into the present. Choosing to code with clarity, produce with passion, and parent with presence. This blog is part dev journal, part life log, part creative archive. It’s here to track the real growth, the unexpected lessons, and the progress that happens when you commit fully to change.
   </p>

   <p>If you’re reading this and you’ve ever felt like you were starting too late ...trust me, you’re not. I’m just getting started, too. Let’s keep building.
